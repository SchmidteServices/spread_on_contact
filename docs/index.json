    "keywords": "Let people move less The second example In the second example we restrict movement of people - this is the only parameter we change. However, before we do this second simulation you need to understand how Movement works . Movement Each person can do maxMovesPerDay . Before each move, a person decides to make a move or not, based on a certain probability. For example, 100 means each person will definitely do maxMovesPerDay . If you wanna reduce movement, set Move Probability=25 so that there only a chance of 1:4 (=25%) a person will make a move. This represent the government's Stay At Home advice. For the second example, change Move probability (for healthy and infected) to 25% . Isn't that interesting? See how many people have not got infected at all and how shallow the curve is! However, nothing is for free: look at the timing! It would take 160 \"days\" compared to only 80 of the first \"let it go\" example. Will our economy survive if we move less? Moves in detail go back"

    "keywords": "Early recognition The simulation allows us to place people under quarantine . Quarantined people won't infect others anymore because they are in a (virtual) place where only quarantined people live and which is not accessible for other healthy people. Of course, humans rights etc. .. sure, we would never do this in reality today. But, read about leprosy and how this was handled at the times when there was no medicine against it: quarantine! The third example Ok, lets simulate! Set back the Move Probablity from example two to 50 / 100 / 100 or restart the app . Instead, change the Quarantine probablity after infect to 50% . This means: 2 to 5 days after someone got infected we will recognize its infection and put 50% of those people into quarantine to avoid they infect others. See the grey line evolving from the ground. This is the number of people under quarantine. Interesting to see the shallow curve for seriously infected people. And watch the duration of the break-out: it takes around only 100 days. One more thing: you could probably see ***\" the dance\"*** that comes behind \"the hammer\" (behind the maximum - between day 50 and 75). \"The dance\" is the longer-term effort to keep this virus contained until there’s a vaccine. This is the time when infection rates may go up again depending on peoples behavior. Important note: we are simulating random moves . If you see the dance as in the picture above depends on how your simulation goes. Each simulation run will show you different results. Last but not least, look at the blue curve: how many people have not been infected at then end? go back"

    "keywords": "The first run After the first run you'll get a chart like shown below. With the default parameters you will see that almost all people will get infected and round about 4% to 5% will die. The default setup simulates the situation when people simply ignore that Corona virus is serious (no preventive measures have been taken). So we let people move/behave as normal. Almost all people will get the infection and all this will happen very fast. Note: This was the initial approach in Great Britain and in the Netherlands. Both have stopped it. Interesting to see how this compares to our second example , later. Changes in the latest version Lately, I heard about the 60% to 70% rate of infection: \" Coronavirus: 60% of UK population need to become infected so country can build 'herd immunity', government's chief scientist says \" (ref. Independent ). This phenomenon is called \" herd immunity \", but the numbers when this will happen differ. I have implemented to 60% to 70% of the population has got the infect: ![Herd immunity](./images/herdIm munity.png) The diagrams shows this herd immunity effect with a lighter red line when 60% of the population is sick together with a solid blue line. After the 70% limit has been reached, the chart will become again a bit lighter to illustrate the worst lies behind. The chart explained y-axis: Number of people x-axis: Day No. It is important to notice, the Days are not real days! In fact, it is more the number of simulation turns until the break-out will reach its end. Take this number to compare charts with other simulation runs to see how your changes may impact the duration of the break-out at all. (In example 2 we will restrict people's movements and you will see, the duration of the break-out changing significantly). Lines Line Color Meaning Blue Healthy people, not yet infected. At the end of the simulation see the healthy=36 in the headline. This means, after 82 days out of a population of 4600 only 36 people did not get the infection. Yellow People who are sick and may infect others Red Line Total amount of people who are sick or infected only (no break-out yet). Red Area The red area above the yellow line shows the number of infected people, which is the serious quantity! Those people move around and infect others without knowing they're infected. Purple People who are seriously sick and need professional assistance. This is obviously a serious number because it directly relates the capacity of the health system. Green People who got infected but have recovered from Corona. Assumption is that if someone gets infected he won't get it again (that's how the simulation is designed!). Black People who died because of Corona infection. go back"

    "title": "Corona (COVID-19) outbreak simulation",
    "keywords": "Corona (COVID-19) outbreak simulation A couple of days ago, I wanted to understand better how the Corona virus outbreak evolves under different conditions. Does it really help to stay at home? Would it help to have a vaccination? Or would it be more effective to quarantine infected people as early as possible (early warning system)? Which impact has the density of population etc. One important thing: Share this app faster than Corona and we will succeed! I invented a simple model to simulate the Corona outbreak and how it infects people. My first model is called Random Moves . I have other models in mind ... let's see how this app evolves. If you're interested in some more background information, you may read about \" the hammer and the dance \". Random Moves Model The idea is simple: Take a playground of a certain size, for example, 1000x1000. Drop a number of people on this area. Infect some of them with COVID-19, and let them randomly move , meet and infect each other. Simple as that! A density of 4600 people per km² represents Munich (Germany) . According to Wikipedia , New York Citys density is: Density= 10715/km², Milan is: 7700/km². Find the city of your choice ... . For now, leave the 4600, click on the Start button and see how it evolves... [TIP]: It is better to turn you mobile to Landscape Mode. Please be patient, as it takes some seconds to load the chart. There is no slider - the chart will move itself to show you progress over time. Analyze the results of your first simulation. Let people move less - the second example. Early recognition - the third example . Now it is up to you ... You may change the Infection Probabability which determines the probability a healthy person will get infected if it comes closer than Infection Distance to an infected, sick person. Infection Probability when persons \"meet\". Vaccination If we had a vaccination, for example, the infection probablity would go down to a certain limit, e.g. 30%. This is due to the fact s : a) not all people will get vaccination and b) vaccination will not prevent all people from getting infected. It your turn! Find out the best solution! How does this map to reality? It does not map to reality at all, because reality is much more complex. This simulation is just for fun! However, it may give you some impressions how different approaches to tackle the break-out may perform. Other models I was thinking, that especially other movement models may change the results of the simulation. For example, magnetic points . The idea behind is, to implement some points on the map where people tend to go to more often, for example, supermarkets, U-Bahn, etc. This was to simulate these 'meetings points' a bit better. Another model could be to simulate the \"stay at home\" approach a bit better. Lock a certain number of people in a room - let these groups moves less etc. You see, there are many more ideas... Enjoy it, anyways, MarkusS (Markus Schmidt, Germany)"
